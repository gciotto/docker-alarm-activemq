# Apache activemq docker container

A debian-based docker container for the alarm server's JMS layer.

Execute `build-docker-alarm-activemq.sh` to create the image and `run-docker-alarm-activemq.sh` to start a container with it. These scripts should not be used for deployment. Instead, use one of the available tools in [here](https://github.com/lnls-sirius/docker-alarm-composed).
